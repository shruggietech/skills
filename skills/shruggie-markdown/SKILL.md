name: shruggie-markdown
description: Encodes the ShruggieTech house style for authoring Markdown documents (single-H1 structure, the labeled front-matter block, heading spacing, automatic anchors and manual tables of contents, prose-first density, GFM footnotes, language-tagged code fences, base64 image embedding, and Mermaid or SVG diagrams). Applies whenever Claude is writing or refactoring a Markdown document to house style. Trigger on phrasings like "write this as a Markdown doc to house style", "format this README", "add a TOC", "embed this image in the Markdown", or "make a Mermaid diagram for this". This skill is the Markdown authoring house style, not the shruggie-markdown software product; do not fire it for software, build, packaging, or release requests about that product.
disable-model-invocation: false
user-invocable: true
when_to_use: Use when writing or cleaning up any Markdown document (README, report, spec, sprint plan, case study, agent context file) to the ShruggieTech standard, or when the operator says "fix the headings", "add footnotes", "make this self-contained", or "turn this into a Mermaid diagram". Do not use for the shruggie-markdown software product or for non-Markdown output.

# Shruggie Markdown

Author Markdown documents to the ShruggieTech house style so output is consistent
across GitHub, editor previews, and HTML or PDF render pipelines. This skill is
knowledge and formatting: once invoked it tells Claude how to structure, format,
and assemble Markdown. The concise standing rules are below; the worked examples,
the edge cases, and the "what renders where" matrix live under `assets/` and load
only when you need them.

This skill is named identically to an unrelated ShruggieTech software product, also
called `shruggie-markdown`. The skill is about authoring Markdown documents to house
style. It is not the software. Do not invoke it for software, build, packaging, or
release work about that product.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:

- The user asks to write, format, or clean up a Markdown document to house style
  (README, report, spec, sprint plan, case study, agent context file).
- The user asks for a specific Markdown construct: a table of contents, footnotes,
  an embedded image, a Mermaid diagram, a front-matter metadata block.
- The user asks to refactor an existing Markdown file so it follows the house
  conventions (heading spacing, single H1, language-tagged fences).

Do not invoke this skill for:

- The `shruggie-markdown` software product. Build, packaging, configuration, and
  release requests about the product are out of scope; if the operator means the
  software, say so and stop rather than formatting anything.
- Non-Markdown output (HTML pages, `.docx`, PDF generation). Those have their own
  skills (`shruggie-html`, `shruggie-docs`). This skill may note a render caveat
  for a Markdown document destined for PDF and stop there.
- Retroactively reformatting the existing document corpus. The skill governs new
  authoring, not a sweep of already-shipped files.

## Audience gate (read first)

Every rule below is gated on who reads the output document:

- AI-only documents (sprint plans, agent context files, session reports, spec
  updates consumed by agents) are pure Markdown. HTML is prohibited outright.
- Human-facing documents (READMEs, reports, case studies) are pure Markdown by
  default, and may use the three allowlisted HTML constructs only after confirming
  the document renders somewhere that honors the markup.

When in doubt about the audience, ask. When the document targets more than one
surface, format for the lowest common denominator (see
`assets/renderer-compatibility.md`).

## House-style rules

### Document structure

- The first line of the rendered body is a single `#` H1, and it is the only `#`
  heading in the document. Everything below is `##` or deeper. A document with a
  machine-read YAML front matter block opens with the `---` block, and the single
  H1 is the first body line after the closing `---`.
- Every heading has exactly one blank line above and one blank line below. The
  only exception is a heading at the top of the file or immediately after a closing
  front matter `---`, which has no blank line above.
- Do not place a `---` horizontal rule directly above or below a heading; GitHub
  already draws a border under H1 and H2. A `---` on the line right after non-blank
  text becomes a setext H2, not a rule, so keep a blank line above any intentional
  rule. Use rules sparingly, only as a true section break in long human-facing
  documents.

### Front-matter field block

Directly under the H1, an optional labeled metadata block (Source, References,
Audience, Author, Date) is encouraged. Keys are bold, values regular weight,
inline backtick code allowed in a value that is a path or literal. Each field is
its own line, so a hard line break is required at the end of each line. Use a
trailing backslash (`\`) as the hard break; it survives whitespace trimming,
linters, and `.gitattributes` normalization. The two-trailing-spaces alternative
renders identically but the repo `CONVENTIONS.md` forbids trailing whitespace and
formatters strip it, which collapses the block. For committed documents, use the
backslash.

Halt-gate: if the operator wants committed documents to use two-trailing-space
breaks, that needs an explicit `CONVENTIONS.md` carve-out. Do not silently add
trailing whitespace to repo files; surface the decision.

### Prose density

Paragraphs are encouraged. Bullets are for genuinely enumerable items (options,
steps, parameters, rules). Explanatory and narrative content is prose, not a list
of fragments. This is a stated house preference.

### Anchors, links, and tables of contents

GitHub auto-generates an anchor slug for every heading: lowercase, strip every
character that is not a letter, digit, space, or hyphen, then turn spaces into
hyphens (duplicates get `-1`, `-2`). An internal link is `[text](#slug)`. There is
no automatic in-body TOC; a TOC is a manual list of `[Heading](#slug)` links.
Explicit `<a id>` anchors are HTML, audience-gated, and usually unnecessary; for
GitHub-targeted documents rely on the automatic slug and do not hand-roll anchors.

### Footnotes

Use GFM footnotes: a `[^label]` reference in the prose and a `[^label]:`
definition at the bottom. The label is an identifier, not a display number; the
renderer numbers footnotes by order of first reference. Footnotes are a GFM
extension: they render on GitHub and in pandoc, but bare CommonMark shows the
literal `[^label]`, so confirm the target.

### Code fences

Every fenced block declares its language on the opening fence (`bash`,
`powershell`, `json`, `yaml`, `python`, `markdown`, `mermaid`, `text` for no
highlighting, and so on). To show a block that itself contains triple backticks,
fence the outer block with one more backtick than the longest inner run (four for
a normal nested block).

### Images

Prefer a committed image file with a relative path, `![alt](assets/diagram.png)`,
whenever the document must render on GitHub. For a single-file document read or
rendered outside GitHub, embed the image as a base64 `data:` URI using a
reference-style image in the body and the definition at the very bottom of the
file. Generate the definition with the bundled scripts, never by hand. Data-URI
images do not render on GitHub.

### Diagrams

Mermaid is the default; GitHub renders a fenced `mermaid` block natively. Fallbacks
are a committed `.svg` file referenced as an image (renders on GitHub) or inline
`<svg>` (HTML, audience-gated, unreliable on GitHub). Never draw diagrams as ASCII
or box-drawing characters: alignment drifts, agents reproduce them unreliably, and
they are inaccessible. Route every diagram to Mermaid or SVG.

## HTML policy

Default deny. A Markdown document uses pure Markdown unless a specific construct
genuinely requires HTML. Exactly three constructs in this skill require HTML, and
each is gated:

1. Justified text (`<div style="text-align: justify;">`)
2. Explicit heading anchors (`<a id="...">`)
3. Inline SVG (`<svg>...</svg>`)

The gate is audience. For AI-only documents, HTML is prohibited outright. For
human-facing documents, HTML is permitted only for those three constructs, and only
after confirming the document will be rendered somewhere that honors the markup
(see `assets/renderer-compatibility.md`). HTML used for pure decoration is never
permitted. Every HTML example in this skill lives inside a fenced code block; the
skill body itself is pure Markdown.

## Scripts

Generate base64 data-URI image definitions with the bundled scripts rather than by
hand. Both emit the same `[label]: data:<mime>;base64,<blob>` definition for the
bottom of the file and the same `![alt][label]` in-body usage hint.

- Bash: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/encode-image-datauri.sh -i <image> [-l label] [-a alt] [-o file]`
- PowerShell: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/Encode-ImageDataUri.ps1 -Path <image> [-Label label] [-Alt alt] [-OutFile file]`

## Output hygiene

Every Markdown file the skill writes complies with `CONVENTIONS.md`:

- UTF-8 with no BOM, LF line endings, no trailing whitespace (the front-matter
  backslash break exists precisely so the block needs none), a single trailing
  newline.
- Zero em-dashes and zero en-dashes anywhere, including inside code comments and
  `alt` text. Use parentheses, commas, or standard hyphens.
- No AI rhetorical tropes, especially the "not just X, it's Y" contrast.
- Every fenced code block declares a language.
- For plans, sprint documents, and update logs, sequence sessions chronologically.
