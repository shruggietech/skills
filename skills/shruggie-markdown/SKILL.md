# Shruggie Markdown

Author Markdown documents to the ShruggieTech house style so output is consistent
across GitHub, editor previews, and HTML or PDF render pipelines. This skill is
knowledge and formatting: once invoked it tells Claude how to structure, format,
and assemble Markdown. The concise standing rules are below; the worked examples,
the edge cases, and the "what renders where" matrix live under `assets/` and load
only when you need them.

This skill is named identically to an unrelated ShruggieTech software product, also
called `shruggie-markdown`. The skill is about authoring Markdown documents to house
style. It is not the software. Do not invoke it for software, build, packaging,
or release work about that product.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:

- The user asks to write, format, or clean up a Markdown document to house style
  (README, report, spec, sprint plan, case study, agent context file).
- The user asks for a specific Markdown construct: a table of contents, footnotes,
  an embedded image, a Mermaid diagram, a front-matter metadata block.
- The user asks to refactor an existing Markdown file so it follows the house
  conventions (heading spacing, single H1, language-tagged fences).

Do not invoke this skill for:

- The `shruggie-markdown` software product. Build, packaging, configuration, and
  release requests about the product are out of scope; if the operator means the
  software, say so and stop rather than formatting anything.
- Non-Markdown output (HTML pages, `.docx`, PDF generation). Those have their own
  skills (`shruggie-html`, `shruggie-docs`). This skill may note a render caveat
  for a Markdown document destined for PDF and stop there.
- Retroactively reformatting the existing document corpus. The skill governs new
  authoring, not a sweep of already-shipped files.

## Audience gate (read first)

Every rule below is gated on who reads the output document:

- AI-only documents (sprint plans, agent context files, session reports, spec
  updates consumed by agents) are pure Markdown. HTML is prohibited outright.
- Human-facing documents (READMEs, reports, case studies) are pure Markdown by
  default, and may use the three allowlisted HTML constructs only after confirming
  the document renders somewhere that honors the markup.

When in doubt about the audience, ask. When the document targets more than one
surface, format for the lowest common denominator (see
`assets/renderer-compatibility.md`).

## House-style rules

### Document structure

- The first line of the rendered body is a single `#` H1, and it is the only `#`
  heading in the document. Everything below is `##` or deeper. A document with a
  machine-read YAML front matter block opens with the `---` block, and the single
  H1 is the first body line after the closing `---`.
- Every heading has exactly one blank line above and one blank line below. The
  only exception is a heading at the top of the file or immediately after a closing
  front matter `---`, which has no blank line above.
- Do not place a `---` horizontal rule directly above or below a heading; GitHub
  already draws a border under H1 and H2. A `---` on the line right after non-blank
  text becomes a setext H2, not a rule, so keep a blank line above any intentional
  rule. Use rules sparingly, only as a true section break in long human-facing
  documents.

### Front-matter field block

Directly under the H1, an optional labeled metadata block (Source, References,
Audience, Author, Date) is encouraged. Keys are bold, values regular weight,
inline backtick code allowed in a value that is a path or literal. Each field is
its own line, so a hard line break is required at the end of each line. Use a
trailing backslash (`\`) as the hard break; it survives whitespace trimming,
linters, and `.gitattributes` normalization. The two-trailing-spaces alternative
renders identically but the repo `CONVENTIONS.md` forbids trailing whitespace and
formatters strip it, which collapses the block. For committed documents, use the
backslash.

Halt-gate: if the operator wants committed documents to use two-trailing-space
breaks, that needs an explicit `CONVENTIONS.md` carve-out. Do not silently add
trailing whitespace to repo files; surface the decision.

### Prose density

Paragraphs are encouraged. Bullets are for genuinely enumerable items (options,
steps, parameters, rules). Explanatory and narrative content is prose, not a list
of fragments. This is a stated house preference.

### Line length and wrapping

The house default hard-wrap width is 80 columns, measured in source
characters, not rendered width. Recognized operator overrides are 100 and
120 columns; when the operator asks in plain language ("wrap at 100", "use a
120-column wrap"), apply that width for that document. If the operator
explicitly requests no hard wrapping ("no hard wrap", "disable wrapping",
"one line per paragraph"), the document uses soft wrapping only: one logical
line per paragraph and one per list item, with no inserted hard breaks. That
mode is opt-in; the default stays 80.

Hard-wrap body prose paragraphs and the text of list items (bulleted,
ordered, and footnote definitions) to the active width. Never hard-wrap and
never merge these constructs:

- ATX headings.
- Fenced code blocks and everything inside them.
- GFM pipe tables: never wrap or reflow a table row or a delimiter row.
- The machine-read YAML front-matter block, if present.
- The labeled front-matter field block (Source, References, Audience, Author,
  Date): each field stays on its own line ending with the trailing-backslash
  hard break.
- Reference-style link and image definitions, and base64 data-URI definition
  lines.
- Unbreakable tokens (URLs, file paths, inline code spans): do not split
  them. If one pushes a line past the width, let that line overflow rather
  than break the token.

Halt-gate: when a table row, fence line, or heading necessarily exceeds the
active width and the operator lints with default MD013, surface that the lint
config needs exceptions (`tables: false`, `code_blocks: false`, or a raised
`heading_line_length`). Do not mangle those constructs to dodge the linter.

Continuation-line safety has the highest priority and overrides the width
limit. Insert hard breaks only at spaces between words; never break inside an
inline code span, a `[text](url)` link, an image, or a URL. Indent every
continuation line of a list item to the item's content column (the marker
width plus its trailing space): two spaces for a `-`, `*`, or `+` bullet, and
three for a single-digit ordered marker such as `1. ` (match the actual
marker width for wider ordered markers). Footnote definition continuations
align under the text after `[^label]: ` by the same rule. Plain paragraph
continuations start at column 0.

After its indentation, a continuation line MUST NOT begin with a sequence
that a CommonMark or GFM parser reads as the start of a block. The forbidden
leading sequences are:

- an unordered list marker: `-`, `*`, or `+` followed by a space or tab;
- an ordered list marker: one or more digits followed by `.` or `)` and then
  a space or tab (a year such as `2016.` is the classic trap);
- an ATX heading: one to six `#` characters followed by a space or tab;
- a blockquote marker: `>`;
- a code fence: three or more backticks or three or more tildes;
- a thematic break or setext underline: a run made only of the characters
  `-`, `*`, `_`, or `=`;
- a table row (`|`), an HTML block (`<`), a link reference definition
  (`[label]:`), or a footnote definition (`[^label]:`).

Leading indentation does NOT neutralize these. An indented `- ` under a
bullet is silently parsed as a nested bullet, and an indented `2016.` becomes
a nested ordered list; both are silent structural corruption, which is the
exact failure this rule exists to prevent. If the natural break at the active
width would place a forbidden token at the start of the continuation line,
move the break earlier so the token stays at the end of the current line,
even if the current line then ends a few characters short of the width.
Safety wins over width. If no safe earlier break exists on that line, leave
the token in place and allow the overflow. The two most common triggers are
the house style's spaced hyphen used as a dash (` - `) and a number or
ordinal followed by a period (`2016.`, `3.`); wrapping near either one
requires this check. Worked examples in `assets/authoring-reference.md`.

### Anchors, links, and tables of contents

GitHub auto-generates an anchor slug for every heading: lowercase, strip every
character that is not a letter, digit, space, or hyphen, then turn spaces into
hyphens (duplicates get `-1`, `-2`). An internal link is `[text](#slug)`. There
is no automatic in-body TOC; a TOC is a manual list of `[Heading](#slug)` links.
Explicit `<a id>` anchors are HTML, audience-gated, and usually unnecessary; for
GitHub-targeted documents rely on the automatic slug and do not hand-roll anchors.

### Footnotes

Use GFM footnotes: a `[^label]` reference in the prose and a `[^label]:`
definition at the bottom. The label is an identifier, not a display number; the
renderer numbers footnotes by order of first reference. Footnotes are a GFM
extension: they render on GitHub and in pandoc, but bare CommonMark shows the
literal `[^label]`, so confirm the target.

### Code fences

Every fenced block declares its language on the opening fence (`bash`,
`powershell`, `json`, `yaml`, `python`, `markdown`, `mermaid`, `text` for no
highlighting, and so on). To show a block that itself contains triple backticks,
fence the outer block with one more backtick than the longest inner run (four for
a normal nested block).

### Images

Prefer a committed image file with a relative path, `![alt](assets/diagram.png)`,
whenever the document must render on GitHub. For a single-file document read or
rendered outside GitHub, embed the image as a base64 `data:` URI using a
reference-style image in the body and the definition at the very bottom of the
file. Generate the definition with the bundled scripts, never by hand. Data-URI
images do not render on GitHub.

### Diagrams

Mermaid is the default; GitHub renders a fenced `mermaid` block natively. Fallbacks
are a committed `.svg` file referenced as an image (renders on GitHub) or inline
`<svg>` (HTML, audience-gated, unreliable on GitHub). Never draw diagrams as ASCII
or box-drawing characters: alignment drifts, agents reproduce them unreliably, and
they are inaccessible. Route every diagram to Mermaid or SVG.

## HTML policy

Default deny. A Markdown document uses pure Markdown unless a specific construct
genuinely requires HTML. Exactly three constructs in this skill require HTML, and
each is gated:

1. Justified text (`<div style="text-align: justify;">`)
2. Explicit heading anchors (`<a id="...">`)
3. Inline SVG (`<svg>...</svg>`)

The gate is audience. For AI-only documents, HTML is prohibited outright. For
human-facing documents, HTML is permitted only for those three constructs, and only
after confirming the document will be rendered somewhere that honors the markup
(see `assets/renderer-compatibility.md`). HTML used for pure decoration is never
permitted. Every HTML example in this skill lives inside a fenced code block; the
skill body itself is pure Markdown.

## Scripts

Generate base64 data-URI image definitions with the bundled scripts rather than
by hand. Both emit the same `[label]: data:<mime>;base64,<blob>` definition for
the bottom of the file and the same `![alt][label]` in-body usage hint.

- Bash: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/encode-image-datauri.sh`
  `-i <image> [-l label] [-a alt] [-o file]`
- PowerShell: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/Encode-ImageDataUri.ps1`
  `-Path <image> [-Label label] [-Alt alt] [-OutFile file]`

## Output hygiene

Every Markdown file the skill writes complies with `CONVENTIONS.md`:

- UTF-8 with no BOM, LF line endings, no trailing whitespace (the front-matter
  backslash break exists precisely so the block needs none), a single trailing
  newline.
- Zero em-dashes and zero en-dashes anywhere, including inside code comments and
  `alt` text. Use parentheses, commas, or standard hyphens.
- Body prose and list text are hard-wrapped to the house width (default 80);
  see "Line length and wrapping". A wrapped continuation line never begins
  with a Markdown block marker.
- No AI rhetorical tropes, especially the "not just X, it's Y" contrast.
- Every fenced code block declares a language.
- For plans, sprint documents, and update logs, sequence sessions chronologically.
